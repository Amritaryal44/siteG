SiteG supports google form. So to include google form, you will need to follow some steps. Let's see how.
1. Open this link. [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms)
2. Click ```Blank``` to get a new form.
![Screenshot][form-img1]
3. First input should be like this.
![Screenshot][form-img2]
4. The whole form should look like this.
![Screenshot][form-img3]
5. Now get the link of the form. Click the ```send``` button.<br>
![Screenshot][form-img4]
6. Copy the link from here.
![Screenshot][form-img5]<br>
Replace ```/viewform``` to ```/formResponse```. It should look like ```https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/<form-id>/formResponse```.
Paste it in the action input of ```contact section```

7. For rest of inputs, paste it in new tab of browser and Hit ```Ctrl+Shift+I``` to open inspector and Focus on ```search HTML``` as shown in red box.<br>
![Screenshot][form-img7]
Now, search for "```entry.```" and you will see like this.
![Screenshot][form-img8]
> First one is for ```name```<br>
> Second one is for ```email```<br>
> Third one is for ```message```

Hurray! Form can now be submitted from your site.

## 4. Posts

Click ```Go to Posts``` to post or edit articles. After clicking it, you will go to ```Category``` section. Category is here just to tell people what kind of posts you are writing.

Add a category and click it to go to ```post``` section.

If you want to ```delete``` or ```rename``` it, just right-click the category folder.

See!! Its that simple.
Now, Let's add new post.

![Screenshot][post-img5]

Click it and you will see a window like below:
![Screenshot][post-img6]

In ```Post Setup```, you can write short descriptions and keywords about the post.

Next is ```Image for the post```. Here, you have to add the images you want to add in the post article.

Third is Markdown Editor. You can write post in markdown format. Also enabling ```Allow HTML``` will allow you to write in html format. You can learn to write markdown from [Common Mark](https://commonmark.org/help/). As it supports syntax from Common Mark, I would recommend learning from there. It's so easy and interesting than writing normal documents. :happy:

A demo file is already loaded in the editor to help you.

Things you need to know while writing markdown:
1. **Heading**: Do not use Heading 1. Start from Heading 2 and so on.
2. **Image**: For uploading image from your PC, First upload the image in ```Image for the post```. Then, copy the link generated below the added image and paste the link with image syntax in markdown. I will show a demo.

    * Upload the image<br>
    ![Screenshot][post-img7]
    * Get File Path<br>
    ![Screenshot][post-img8]
    * Go to Markdown Editor below and hit ```Ctrl+SPACE``` to get image snippet.<br>
    ![Screenshot][post-img9]
    * Now hitting ```Enter``` will produce a img code like this.<br>
    ![Screenshot][post-img10]
    * Replace ```alttext``` with image description and press ```TAB```. and give post id and image id. In this example, post-id is 1 and image-id is 1. Now it should look like this.
        ```bash
        ![Chair made on blender](/posts/images/1/1-1.jpg "Chair 3D model")
        ```

## 5. For modification
